# Dac_TweetNoise
Datamining project based on Tweet Noise project
The goal of the Tweet Noise project was to be able to determine whether a tweet contains actuality or not.
Here we are going to analyse a set a tweet collected

NB : the two files to look at are jupyter notebook. Please open them with jupyter 

*  **Analysis and visualisation of the features**   
The first files to look at is **pretraitement.ipynb** which deals with how to look into a set of features extracted from tweets (built with 'featuresBuilder_Dac.py')

*  **Analysis and clusterisation with the text**   
The second files **textClustering.ipynb** deals with text processing and how we can clusterize the tweet collected based on their text
